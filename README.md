This is a fork of the original project.

This project demo is published at: https://phiggins.quarto.pub/quarto-live-book

To make this project work, I

1.  opened the project as a New Project/Quarto book

2.  Went to the Terminal tab, then entered 'quarto add r-wasm/quarto-live' to add the right extension

3.  Then agreed to trust the authors (Yes)

4.  Then edited the \_quarto.yml file to look like this:

project:<br>   type: book <br>

book: <br>   title: "quarto-live-book" <br>   author: "PDRH" <br>   date: "3/1/2025" <br>   chapters: <br>     - index.qmd <br>     - intro.qmd <br>     - summary.qmd <br>     - references.qmd <br>

bibliography: references.bib <br>

format: live-html <br> engine: knitr <br> editor: visual <br>

5.  Then at the top of each of the default chapters (index.qmd, intro.qmd, summary.qmd) inserted the following at the top of each file:

`---` <br> format: live-html <br> webr: <br>   packages: <br>     - dplyr <br>     - palmerpenguins <br>     - ggplot2 <br> `---` <br>

`{{< include ./_extensions/r-wasm/live/_knitr.qmd >}}`

This sets the format to that chapter to live-html, and loads 3 packages (you can change these to whatever packages you might need in that chapter).

The last bit, outside of the yaml header, sets up the knitr engine for R

6.  Then for each code chunk, if I want it to be static - leave the chunk label as something like this:

{r chunk-name}

If I want it to be a LIVE code chunk, I need to start the code chunk with {webr} like this:

{webr chunk-name2}

7.  Then I edit each qmd file, and render it to make sure it looks like what I expect.

8.  Then to publish this to the quarto-pub website, I go back to Terminal, to the directory for this project, then enter `quarto publish` and Enter <br> I will be asked whether to publish to my usual quarto-pub domain (say yes, Enter) and it renders the whole book for me (after asking me to confirm authorization to quarto-pubs) to quarto-pubs <br> <br>
